"Hello, *World*!"

Talk about a clich√© first blog post title...

I've blogged many, many times before. I've had blogs that acted as personal journals. I've had blogs
with lots of useless articles covering programming topics that were supposed to make me look
smart to potential employers when I was looking for my first job. This time, things will be
different.

On this blog, I'll keep it short and sweet. I will add overviews of any personal projects I am
working on. From time to time, if I really feel like I have something worth covering I will share
it. "Worth" here being defined by its potential usefulness to the general public.

This blog itself is a personal project of sorts. It's written in [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/),
a Python framework I've wanted to play around with for a long time now. I can safely say I've
enjoyed the experience. It's incredible easy to get started with Flask and given how lightweight it
is, with a good background in Python you can customize it to your heart's content.

The repo for this blog is now public and
[can be viewed here](https://github.com/benlavon/benlavonweb).

That's all for now... hopefully so more interesting stuff coming soon.
