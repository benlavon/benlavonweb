I've decided to put a bit more effort into this thing...

I might even create a more convenient pipeline for getting posts up here. And some proper CSS!

Currently, I'm deploying through Heroku directly from the terminal. [The source code for this blog is hosted here.](https://github.com/benlavon/benlavonweb)

This blog uses a nice little package called [Flask-FlatPages](https://flask-flatpages.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.1/), which means I don't need to deal with any databases and these posts are simply static Markdown files but getting them up at the moment isn't really conducive to a nice blogging workflow, which is something I need to work on.

This post is mostly a test after getting this app working locally again. I haven't used Python or Flask in around a year now and it took me about an hour to get up and running again.

Below is an arbitrary code block to test if the Markdown code highlighting plugin I've installed is working.

```
from flask import Flask
from flask_flatpages import FlatPages

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.from_pyfile('mysettings.cfg')
pages = FlatPages(app)
```

Bye for now!
